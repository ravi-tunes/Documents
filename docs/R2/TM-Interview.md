**INTERVIEW QUESTION BANK – TM (Senior Director, Engineering @ Chase Travel)**
---

SECTION 1 — Vision, Strategy & Transformation

---

1. How do you define platform strategy in the context of Chase Travel’s multi-domain ecosystem?

Answer (Director-level):
“Platform strategy here means enabling all travel domains — Flights, Lodging, Cruises, Ground Transport — to leverage common capabilities like search, booking, payments, and customer data, instead of reinventing them.

For me, it’s about turning these capabilities into modular, reusable platform services. Each domain can innovate independently, but within a unified architecture — consistent APIs, observability, resilience, and compliance.

I’d define the strategy around three pillars:
	1.	Unification: One platform language and governance across .NET and Java stacks.
	2.	Modernization: Gradual migration of legacy .NET Framework services to cloud-native .NET 8 microservices.
	3.	Enablement: Self-service tooling and shared CI/CD so teams can move fast but stay aligned.

That’s how I’d connect business outcomes — faster time to market, improved customer experience — to technical alignment.”

2. How would you approach transforming legacy .NET product suites into a unified, modern platform?

Answer:
“I’d approach this in three waves:
	1.	Assessment: Catalog every .NET application across travel domains — framework version, hosting, dependencies, observability maturity.
	2.	Standardization: Define the target-state reference architecture (.NET 8, containerized, consistent CI/CD and logging).
	3.	Execution: Pick one product suite for a pilot modernization (say, Lodging) and use it to demonstrate value — better performance, lower MTTR, faster releases.

Transformation must be incremental and data-driven. I’d publish modernization metrics — % migrated to .NET Core, % of services containerized — and communicate wins early.

At Barclays, I led a similar transformation: moving legacy deployment models to automated TeamCity pipelines, standardizing frameworks, and modernizing services without disrupting the business. I’d bring that same pragmatic, high-accountability approach here.”

3. How do you balance governance with innovation for teams that have historically operated independently?

Answer:
“The key is to lead with partnership, not policing.

Teams need to see governance as a productivity booster. I usually start by finding a few early adopters, co-creating patterns with them, and letting their success speak for itself.

Governance shouldn’t restrict innovation — it should create a common foundation where innovation thrives safely. I like to structure it as:
	•	Guardrails, not gates: automated standards through templates and CI/CD policies.
	•	Feedback loops: regular architecture forums where teams propose improvements to governance.
	•	Recognition: highlighting teams that adopt and improve shared standards.

The culture shift comes when teams realize governance gives them speed with safety, not red tape.”

---

4. What’s your approach to aligning .NET governance with existing Java platform maturity at Chase?

Answer:
“I’d start by identifying the core principles that transcend language — observability, resilience, security, and CI/CD maturity — then map their Java equivalents into .NET analogs.

For example:
	•	Spring Boot → ASP.NET Core standardization.
	•	Splunk/ELK logging → Serilog + Elastic APM integration.
	•	Jenkins + Maven pipelines → GitHub Actions/Azure DevOps with NuGet packages.

We don’t need .NET to mirror Java’s stack — just its maturity model. So both ecosystems share one governance playbook and one vocabulary for architecture, metrics, and compliance.

Practically, I’d create a cross-stack Architecture Council — Java, .NET, Security, and Cloud Platform — to ensure decisions converge. That way, the .NET side evolves into parity with the Java world, not in isolation.”

SECTION 2 — Platform Architecture & Engineering Excellence

---

5. How would you architect a scalable, cloud-native .NET Core platform for travel content?

Answer:
“The travel domain has two core demands: high read volume (search) and complex transactions (booking). A scalable .NET Core architecture must handle both efficiently.

I’d design it as a microservices-based architecture with these principles:
	•	Event-driven communication (e.g., using Kafka or Solace) to decouple booking, pricing, and availability updates.
	•	API gateway layer to provide unified access and consistent auth/logging across domains.
	•	Caching & CDN for high-traffic read endpoints (search results).
	•	Resilience patterns (bulkheads, circuit breakers, retries) implemented via Polly.
	•	Observability baked in — metrics (Prometheus), logs (Elastic), and traces (OpenTelemetry).

All services would run on Kubernetes with autoscaling and blue-green deployments. This ensures the platform can handle seasonal spikes — say, during summer or holidays — without manual intervention.

In short: Composable services, automated elasticity, and strong visibility. That’s how I’d architect for both performance and operational peace of mind.”

---

6. How do you ensure reliability and performance in a platform that spans multiple travel domains and vendors?

Answer:
“Reliability in a multi-domain travel system requires visibility, redundancy, and fail-safes.

I’d implement:
	•	End-to-end observability – distributed tracing that covers partner APIs and internal services.
	•	Circuit breakers and graceful degradation – if a vendor feed (say, flights) slows down, the rest of the platform remains functional.
	•	Synthetic transactions – continuous monitoring of core user journeys like ‘search flight → book → confirm’.
	•	Error budgets and SLOs – jointly owned by platform and product teams.

We should treat performance metrics as business KPIs — faster API responses mean higher conversion rates.

I’ve implemented this mindset before — by instrumenting latency and throughput metrics directly into our trading pipelines and correlating them to business events. The same principle applies here: performance equals revenue.”

---

7. How do you drive modernization across product lines while maintaining operational stability?

Answer:
“I take a progressive modernization approach — parallel runs and incremental rollout.

Each modernization project has three key phases:
	1.	De-risking: Shadow deployments where new and old systems run side by side.
	2.	Migration: Gradual cutover using feature flags and canary releases.
	3.	Retirement: Once validated, sunset the old service, clean up tech debt.

Operationally, we maintain strict observability, rollback plans, and versioned APIs to ensure zero downtime.

This is the exact approach I used at Barclays when re-engineering our listed flow — it reduced processing time from 85 minutes to under 8 minutes with zero production incidents during rollout. Stability and transformation can coexist with the right discipline.”

---

SECTION 3 — Execution & Delivery Leadership

---

8. How do you manage delivery across multiple product teams and ensure alignment?

Answer:
“I focus on alignment through outcomes, not tasks.

Each domain team (Flights, Lodging, etc.) should have its own roadmap, but aligned to platform-level OKRs like:
	•	Reduction in time to market.
	•	Improved NFRs (availability, latency).
	•	Increased reuse of common components.

To enforce alignment, I use:
	•	Quarterly PI planning sessions – all domain leads align on dependencies.
	•	Shared KPIs – teams share accountability for platform uptime and cross-domain SLAs.
	•	Transparent dashboards – metrics visible across leadership to encourage collaboration.

As a Director, I don’t manage deliverables — I orchestrate clarity, autonomy, and accountability. That’s how multiple teams stay coordinated without becoming bureaucratic.”

---

9. How would you ensure transformation happens without disrupting business continuity?

Answer:
“By separating platform evolution from product delivery cadence.

Transformation is continuous — but we insulate customer-facing products through:
	•	Backwards compatibility: versioned APIs, adapters, and translation layers.
	•	Automation: regression testing and performance baselines for every release.
	•	Communication: clear go/no-go gates and rollback paths for each migration.

I’ve led modernization efforts in live trading systems where downtime was unacceptable. The same principle applies — you modernize under the hood while business keeps running on the same rails.”

---

10. How do you ensure collaboration between product teams and platform teams?

Answer:
“By making the platform team a partner, not a gatekeeper.

I embed platform engineers in product teams temporarily during migrations — they co-develop, mentor, and collect feedback. This builds empathy and ensures platform decisions are practical.

I also set up bi-directional governance:
	•	Product teams share requirements and issues into platform forums.
	•	Platform teams share updates and patterns back through the same channel.

This structure eliminates ‘us vs them’ — everyone owns the platform experience collectively.”

---

SECTION 4 — People, Culture, and Leadership

---

11. How do you inspire and transform teams used to working in silos into a unified engineering culture?

Answer:
“Transformation starts with psychological safety and storytelling.

I first acknowledge the good work each team has done — they’ve built valuable systems. Then I articulate the ‘why’ of change: consistency reduces outages, shared patterns increase velocity.

Practically, I:
	•	Create architecture guilds — cross-team engineers solving common problems together.
	•	Introduce engineering showcases — teams demo improvements to peers.
	•	Celebrate shared wins publicly.

At Barclays, I took siloed DevOps and development teams and turned them into a horizontal engineering group by giving them a sense of purpose and recognition. It’s amazing how quickly collaboration follows when people feel heard and valued.”

---

12. How do you mentor senior engineers and managers in a transformation program?

Answer:
“Senior engineers need context and challenge.

I involve them early in governance design — they help shape patterns and act as multipliers in their teams.

For managers, I focus on outcome-based leadership — teach them to track metrics like MTTR, lead time, or service reuse instead of just delivery dates.

I also believe in reverse mentorship — I learn from engineers who are deeper in certain stacks. It sets the tone that learning never stops, regardless of level.

The goal is to build leaders who lead engineers, not just manage them.”

---

13. How do you handle resistance to change in legacy teams?

Answer:
“With empathy and evidence.

I’ve learned that resistance often comes from fear — fear of losing autonomy, or of breaking stable systems. I address that by:
	•	Listening first: understand the real pain points.
	•	Starting small: pick a low-risk service and show success.
	•	Measuring outcomes: demonstrate tangible wins (faster builds, fewer incidents).
	•	Empowering champions: let respected engineers lead by example.

Once teams see the improvement, momentum builds naturally. Change led by peers is always stronger than change led by mandates.”

---

14. What’s your philosophy on engineering culture in large organizations?

Answer:
“I believe culture is shaped by what leaders reward and what they tolerate.

I reward experimentation, transparency, and craftsmanship. I don’t tolerate silos or opaque decision-making.

Engineering culture is also about learning — post-incident reviews, brown-bag sessions, internal open source.

At scale, culture isn’t created by slogans — it’s built by consistent behaviors, from leadership down to daily stand-ups.”

---

SECTION 5 — Strategic & Executive Communication

---

15. How do you communicate technical strategy to business executives?

Answer:
“By translating technical progress into business impact.

For example, instead of saying ‘we migrated to .NET Core,’ I’d say ‘we reduced deployment time by 60% and improved resilience by eliminating 80% of manual steps.’

I use dashboards with business-friendly KPIs — uptime, customer latency, cost savings.

Executives don’t need every detail; they need to know: Is the platform reliable, secure, and enabling growth?

As a Director, I make sure every technical initiative has a business narrative attached — technology is how we deliver outcomes.”

---

16. How do you manage stakeholders across multiple lines of business?

Answer:
“With transparency, data, and structure.

I set up quarterly stakeholder syncs with clear metrics: modernization progress, adoption scores, incident trends.

When conflicts arise, I bring data — latency improvements, failure reduction — to guide decisions.

Most importantly, I don’t surprise stakeholders — regular, honest updates build trust faster than perfect results.”

---

SECTION 6 — Vision and Future Readiness

---

17. What’s your long-term vision for Chase Travel’s .NET ecosystem?

Answer:
“My vision is to build a cloud-native, governed, and unified travel platform where all domains — flights, hotels, cars, cruises — share core services, consistent architecture, and best practices.

In 18–24 months:
	•	100% of services on .NET 8+ and containerized.
	•	Unified observability stack with real-time SLA visibility.
	•	Fully automated CI/CD pipelines with zero manual steps.
	•	Platform council driving innovation across domains.

Long term, this foundation enables AI-driven personalization, dynamic pricing, and partner integrations — because the plumbing is stable and predictable.

Governance isn’t the end goal — platform excellence that fuels customer delight is.”
