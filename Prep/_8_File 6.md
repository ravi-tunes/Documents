### 1. Design a New Travel Loyalty Platform for Chase

**The Question:** "Let's design a new travel loyalty platform for Chase. It needs to track points, offer redemption options through partners (airlines, hotels), and provide personalized offers. Walk me through your high-level architectural approach."

**A) What is being evaluated:**
The interviewer is assessing your ability to think at a system level about a complex business domain. They are looking for your architectural fluency, your understanding of distributed systems patterns, your focus on non-functional requirements (scalability, resilience, consistency), and your ability to break down a large problem into manageable components.

**B) What the interviewer is expecting:**
They expect a structured conversation, not a monologue. You should start by asking clarifying questions to define the scope, then outline a high-level component-based architecture (likely microservices). The best answers will naturally weave in the solutions to the follow-up questions as you describe the relevant parts of your architecture, showing holistic thinking.

**C) The awesome answer:**

"Great, that's a fantastic and challenging product. Before I sketch out an architecture, I'd want to clarify a few assumptions to define the scope:
*   **Scale:** Are we designing for millions of Chase's existing customers, so high read/write volume? I'll assume yes.
*   **Partners:** Are we talking about a dozen launch partners, or hundreds? This impacts the complexity of our integration layer. I'll assume we start with a core set and need to scale.
*   **Real-time requirements:** Points updates need to be near real-time, but do personalized offers? I'll assume offers can have a higher latency.

Based on that, I'd propose a **cloud-native, event-driven microservices architecture**. This approach provides the scalability, resilience, and team autonomy needed for a complex platform like this.

Here are the core components I envision:

**(Diagram this on the whiteboard as you speak)**

1.  **User Profile Service:** Manages all customer data, preferences, and loyalty status. This is a core service that other services will query.
2.  **Points Ledger Service:** This is the heart of the system and the source of truth for a customer's points balance. It would be an append-only ledger, recording every single transaction (earn, burn, adjustment). This provides a full, immutable audit trail, which is critical for a financial product.
3.  **Partner Integration Gateway:** A single, dedicated service that acts as a facade for all external partner APIs. It will handle the complexities of different authentication methods, data formats, and communication protocols.
4.  **Redemption Service:** This service orchestrates the process of a customer redeeming points. It would communicate with the User Profile service, the Points Ledger, and the Partner Integration Gateway.
5.  **Offer Generation Service:** A separate, analytical service responsible for processing user data and generating personalized offers.
6.  **Event Bus (e.g., Apache Kafka):** This is the central nervous system of our architecture. Services will communicate asynchronously by publishing and subscribing to events, such as `UserRegistered`, `PointsEarned`, or `FlightBooked`.

Now, let me address how this architecture handles the specific challenges you mentioned."

#### **Follow-up 1: Data Consistency for Points Debit**

**"How would you ensure data consistency when a customer books a flight and their points need to be debited in near real-time?"**

"This is a classic distributed transaction problem, and a two-phase commit is too brittle for a microservices architecture. I would solve this using the **Saga Pattern**.

Here's how the saga for a flight redemption would work:
1.  The `Redemption Service` starts the saga. Its first action is to call the `Partner Integration Gateway` to tentatively book the flight with the airline.
2.  If the booking is successful, the `Redemption Service` then issues a `DebitPoints` command to the `Points Ledger Service`.
3.  The `Points Ledger` attempts to debit the points in a local ACID transaction.
4.  If the debit is successful, the `Redemption Service` calls the `Partner Gateway` again to confirm the booking. The saga is complete.

**The critical part is the rollback.** If the `DebitPoints` command fails (e.g., insufficient balance), the `Redemption Service` is responsible for executing a **compensating action**: it calls the `Partner Gateway` to cancel the tentative booking. This ensures the system remains in a consistent state without using blocking, distributed transactions, which is key for a scalable and resilient system."

#### **Follow-up 2: Resiliency with External Partner APIs**

**"This system will integrate with dozens of external partner APIs, each with varying levels of reliability and speed. How would you design your integration layer to be resilient to their failures?"**

"This is the exact reason for having a dedicated `Partner Integration Gateway`. It's our shock absorber. I'd implement several resilience patterns within this gateway:

1.  **Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL):** For each partner, we'd build an adapter that translates their specific API model into our clean, internal domain model. This prevents their poor design from polluting our system.
2.  **Circuit Breaker Pattern:** If a specific partner's API starts to fail or becomes slow, a circuit breaker (implemented with a library like Polly in .NET) will automatically 'trip' and stop sending requests for a configurable period. We can then fail gracefully, perhaps telling the user 'Airline X is currently unavailable, please try again later,' without our system endlessly waiting and consuming resources.
3.  **Bulkhead Pattern:** We would isolate the connection pools and thread resources used for each partner. This ensures that a single slow or failing partner (e.g., a hotel API that is down) cannot exhaust all the resources of the gateway and bring down our ability to talk to other, healthy partners like airlines. It contains the blast radius of a failure."

#### **Follow-up 3: Personalized Offers without Impacting Core Systems**

**"How would you handle the storage and processing of millions of user profiles to generate personalized offers without impacting the core transactional system?"**

"This is a perfect use case for the **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern**. We need to separate our transactional write path from our analytical read path.

Here's the data flow:
1.  Our core transactional services (`User Profile`, `Points Ledger`, etc.) will publish rich events to our Kafka event bus whenever a meaningful action occurs—a flight search, a point redemption, a profile update.
2.  We will have a separate data pipeline (using something like Apache Flink or Spark Streaming) that consumes these events from Kafka.
3.  This pipeline will process, enrich, and aggregate the data, building a specialized analytical model for each user. This model is optimized specifically for generating offers.
4.  The output of this pipeline is stored in a dedicated **read-optimized data store**, like a document database (e.g., MongoDB) or a search index (e.g., Elasticsearch), which is what the `Offer Generation Service` will query.

This architecture completely decouples the heavy analytical workload from our core transactional systems. The `Points Ledger` can focus on being fast and consistent for transactions, while the offer system can run complex queries without any risk of slowing down a customer's booking."

### 2. Design a Real-Time Fraud Detection System

**The Question:** "We want to build a new fraud detection system for credit card transactions on our travel platform. It needs to provide a risk score in under 100 milliseconds. How would you architect this?"

**A) What is being evaluated:**
Your understanding of low-latency, high-throughput systems. The interviewer is looking for your knowledge of real-time data pipelines, the trade-offs between different analytical models, and your ability to reason about business risk and failure modes in a critical system.

**B) What the interviewer is expecting:**
A design that clearly separates the real-time request/response path from the offline/near-real-time data processing path. They want to hear you talk about the data, the feature engineering, the model serving, and, crucially, what happens when this critical dependency fails.

**C) The awesome answer:**

"A 100ms latency budget for fraud detection is a tight but achievable goal. It means the system must be highly optimized for speed and that any complex data processing must happen *before* the transaction request arrives.

My high-level architecture would consist of two distinct flows: a **Real-Time Data Enrichment Pipeline** and a **Low-Latency Scoring Service.**

**(Whiteboard this as you speak)**

**1. The Real-Time Data Enrichment Pipeline (Asynchronous):**
The goal here is to pre-compute features that our fraud model will need.
*   **Data Ingestion:** We'd stream a wide range of events—user clicks, login attempts, profile changes, historical transactions—into a Kafka topic.
*   **Stream Processing:** A stream processing engine like **Apache Flink** would consume this data. It would perform stateful aggregations in real-time, calculating features like 'number of transactions from this IP address in the last minute,' 'average transaction value for this user,' or 'time since last password change.'
*   **Feature Store:** These pre-computed features are continuously written to a very low-latency **key-value store**, like **Redis or DynamoDB**. The key would be the user ID or credit card hash.

**2. The Low-Latency Scoring Service (Synchronous):**
This is the service that the main payment processing system will call directly.
*   When a user initiates a transaction, the `Payment Service` makes a blocking API call to our `Fraud Scoring Service`, sending basic transaction data (amount, merchant, IP address).
*   The `Fraud Scoring Service` instantly enriches this request by fetching the pre-computed features for that user from the Redis feature store. This is a simple key-value lookup, which is incredibly fast.
*   It then passes this combined feature vector to a locally-hosted fraud detection model to get a risk score.
*   The score is returned to the `Payment Service` within the 100ms SLA.

This design ensures all the heavy lifting is done asynchronously, so the critical synchronous path is just a fast data lookup and an in-memory model inference."

#### **Follow-up 1: Data Pipeline for the ML Model**

**"What kind of data would you need, and how would you design the data pipeline to feed the machine learning model in near real-time?"**

"That data pipeline I just described is the core of the system. The data we'd need is broad:
*   **Transaction Data:** Amount, currency, merchant category, time of day.
*   **User Behavior Data:** Clickstream data, session duration, device fingerprint, IP address.
*   **User Profile Data:** Account age, historical transaction patterns, stored addresses.

The pipeline is designed for near-real-time feeding. As events stream through Kafka, Flink processes them and updates the feature store. This means the features in Redis are always fresh, reflecting user activity within seconds. For the ML model itself, we would have a separate offline process where data scientists use this same event stream (persisted in a data lake) to train and validate new versions of the model, which are then deployed to the `Fraud Scoring Service`."

#### **Follow-up 2: Rules Engine vs. Machine Learning**

**"What are the trade-offs between an in-house rules engine and a machine learning-based model?"**

"That's a critical architectural choice. They aren't mutually exclusive; in fact, the best system uses a **hybrid approach**.

*   **Rules Engine:**
    *   **Pros:** It's deterministic, extremely fast, and the logic is transparent and easily auditable by a compliance team. It's perfect for implementing hard-and-fast business rules like, 'Decline any transaction from a sanctioned country' or 'Flag any transaction over $10,000 for manual review.'
    *   **Cons:** It's brittle. It can't detect novel or complex fraud patterns and can quickly become a spaghetti-mess of thousands of rules that are impossible to manage.

*   **Machine Learning Model:**
    *   **Pros:** It can identify subtle, non-obvious correlations and patterns that a human could never write a rule for. It adapts as fraudster behavior evolves.
    *   **Cons:** It can be a 'black box,' making decisions difficult to explain. It's susceptible to bias in the training data and requires significant infrastructure for training and serving.

**My proposed architecture would be layered:** I would first pass every transaction through a very fast, simple rules engine to knock out the obvious cases. If a transaction passes those rules, it is then sent to the ML model for a more nuanced risk score. This gives us the best of both worlds: the transparency and speed of a rules engine and the intelligence of a machine learning model."

#### **Follow-up 3: Handling Failure or Slow Response**

**"In the event of a failure or a slow response from the fraud service, what should the system do? Should it approve, decline, or flag the transaction? Justify your decision."**

"This is a business risk decision, not just a technical one. The answer depends on the firm's risk appetite. As the engineering director, I would not make this decision in a vacuum; I would present the trade-offs to my product and risk partners. My recommendation would be to implement a **configurable, risk-based failure policy**.

The policy would be:
1.  **Fail-Safe Timeout:** The `Payment Service` must have an aggressive timeout for the call to the fraud service (e.g., 80ms) to protect its own SLA.
2.  **On Timeout or Error, Consult a Policy:**
    *   For **low-value transactions** (e.g., under $50), the policy would be to **'fail-open'**: approve the transaction and log it for offline analysis. The risk of financial loss is low, and the cost of angering a legitimate customer is high.
    *   For **high-value transactions** (e.g., over $1,000), the policy would be to **'fail-closed'**: decline the transaction with a clear message to the user ('Please contact customer support to complete your transaction'). The potential loss outweighs the customer friction.
    *   For **mid-range transactions**, the policy could be to approve but automatically flag the transaction for manual review by a risk analyst.

This dynamic approach allows the business to tune its risk posture without requiring code changes and ensures we are making intelligent, context-aware decisions even when our systems are degraded."
