# Category 7 – Vision, Roadmap & Future of Chase Travel

### Q1 – What’s your long-term vision for Chase Travel’s engineering platform?
**Director-Level Answer**  
> My long-term vision is a unified, cloud-native platform where all travel domains—flights, lodging, ground, activities—share common infrastructure, observability, and governance, yet can innovate independently.  
> Over 18 months, I’d mature three pillars: **Standardization**, **Automation**, and **Empowerment**.

**JPMC-Tailored Alternative**  
> The vision is a *governed self-service ecosystem* built on Chase’s enterprise controls but optimized for speed. We align .NET and Java stacks under the same engineering-excellence metrics, automate policy enforcement, and make every deployment compliant-by-default.

**Drill-Down Details**  
* 18-month themes: modernization 50 %, observability 100 %, developer portal launch, resilience as a service.  
* Key KPIs: deploy freq ↑ 3×; MTTR ↓ 50 %; audit findings zero repeat.  
* Example: Barclays platform reuse ↑ 60 %, release time ↓ 3 days → hours.

### Q2 – What would your first 90 days look like?
**Director-Level Answer (30-60-90 Framework)**  
> **First 30 days:** Listen and map — understand current architecture and governance gaps.  
> **Next 60:** Align — establish baseline metrics, identify quick wins.  
> **Final 30:** Execute — deliver pilot modernization and propose roadmap.

**JPMC-Alternative**  
> **0–30 days:** Assess Chase Travel’s control maturity.  
> **31–60:** Create engineering excellence scorecard.  
> **61–90:** Deliver one pilot end-to-end with compliant pipeline and SLO dashboard.

**Drill-Down Details**  
* Artifacts: maturity heatmap, risk register, quick-win list.  
* Metrics: pipeline reliability 95 %, visibility 100 %.  
* Stakeholder plan: weekly syncs, monthly exec readouts.

### Q3 – How would you define success after 12 months?
**Director-Level Answer**  
> Success = governance and velocity coexist. Adoption > 90 %, MTTR halved, and higher engagement scores.

**JPMC-Alternative**  
> Success = *compliant by default, reliable by design.* 90 % on standard pipeline, all SLOs met, zero repeat audit findings.

**Drill-Down Details**  
* Metrics: Lead time ↓ 70 %, incident recurrence 0 %, dev NPS > 60.  
* Governance dashboards to MD office.

### Q4 – How do you envision evolving the .NET and Java ecosystems together?
**Director-Level Answer**  
> Create parity at the principle level, integration at the platform level. Both share APM, monitoring, and security standards.

**JPMC-Alternative**  
> Build a unified engineering fabric: .NET and Java follow the same guardrails for security, resilience, and controls.

**Drill-Down Details**  
* Shared playbook on auth, observability, resilience.  
* Defect density gap < 5 %.  
* “Parity in principle, autonomy in implementation.”

---

### Q5 – How will you keep innovation alive while maturing controls?
**Director-Level Answer**  
> Create a structured innovation funnel: sandbox environments, pilot approvals, quarterly showcases.

**JPMC-Alternative**  
> Maintain “innovation zones” inside the control framework. Certified pilots get promoted to enterprise standards.

**Drill-Down Details**  
* Innovation charter + sandbox infra.  
* 3 pilots per quarter target.  
* Example: Elastic APM → MTTR ↓ 40 %.

---

### Q6 – How would you attract and retain top engineering talent?
**Director-Level Answer**  
> Engineers stay where they grow. Offer career paths, modern tools, and recognition for technical excellence.

**JPMC-Alternative**  
> Institutionalize Engineering Excellence badging, rotations, and IC career tracks. Build bench strength through challenging work.

**Drill-Down Details**  
* Technical Career Lattice (6 bands).  
* Tech talks ↑ 80 %, attrition ↓ 14 % → 6 %.  
* “People join for mission, stay for culture.”

### Q7 – What are the biggest risks to this transformation? How would you mitigate them?
**Director-Level Answer**  
> Risks: change fatigue, integration complexity, skill gaps. Mitigation: phased delivery, enablement, transparent wins.

**JPMC-Alternative**  
> Risks: control drift, delivery disruption. Mitigation: dual-run, observability, PMO tracking KPIs and exceptions.

**Drill-Down Details**  
* Risk register with RAG status.  
* Fortnightly exec syncs.  
* .NET Core bootcamp for 200 engineers.

---

### Q8 – How do you ensure the transformation remains sustainable after you leave?
**Director-Level Answer**  
> Sustainability = ownership. Governance embedded in process, not personality. Champions, playbooks, and metrics self-report.

**JPMC-Alternative**  
> Sustainability = *controls as culture.* Governance and scorecards evolve independently of leaders.

**Drill-Down Details**  
* “Champions Network” per squad.  
* Playbooks in Git.  
* Maturity assessments quarterly.

---

### Q9 – How would you communicate progress to executives?
**Director-Level Answer**  
> Use data-driven storytelling — dashboards translating metrics into business impact.

**JPMC-Alternative**  
> Quarterly Engineering Health Report: DORA + risk indicators linked to customer experience.

**Drill-Down Details**  
* Velocity vs Quality quadrant.  
* 1-page exec summary format.  
* Example metric: MTTR ↓ 45 %, customer-impact tickets ↓ 60 %.

---

### Q10 – Where do you see Chase Travel’s technology 3 years from now?
**Director-Level Answer**  
> A modular, API-driven platform enabling personalization at scale with enterprise reliability.

**JPMC-Alternative**  
> A cloud-native, AI-assisted travel ecosystem with shared control plane and real-time observability.

**Drill-Down Details**  
* API Gateway + GraphQL for partners.  
* Predictive AI ops.  
* Data mesh connecting travel + banking.  
* Roadmap theme – “From Systems of Record to Systems of Engagement.”
