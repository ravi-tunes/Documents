# Category 3 – Platform Modernization & Strategy

### Q1 – What’s your approach to modernizing a legacy .NET ecosystem?
**Director-Level Answer**  
> Modernization must balance risk and value. I start with an inventory, prioritize by business criticality and tech debt, then apply a “strangler pattern” to incrementally migrate to .NET 8 microservices. Measure each phase on stability and ROI.

**JPMC Alternative**  
> We begin with a portfolio assessment aligned to control risk and customer impact, then progressively move high-value flows to containerized .NET Core services with standard pipelines and policy checks for compliance.

**Drill-Down Details**  
* Tools – Microsoft Upgrade Assistant, APM for runtime profiling.  
* Pilot on low-risk service → proof → scale to 10+.  
* Metrics – defects ↓ 30 %, deployment time ↓ 70 %.  
* Governance – modernization scorecard per suite.

### Q2 – How do you ensure modernization doesn’t disrupt operations?
**Director-Level Answer**  
> Separate modernization stream from core delivery, use shadow deployments and feature flags, and ensure backward compatibility. Run dual telemetry until confidence is high.

**JPMC Alternative**  
> We execute modernization within the change-management framework: dual run, backout plan, and real-time SLO monitoring to prevent user impact. Every cut-over is a controlled change with automated rollback.

**Drill-Down Details**  
* Canary deploy % growth strategy (5→25→100).  
* Pre-production synthetic transactions.  
* Automated rollback via Helm releases.  
* Stakeholder sign-off via CAB.

### Q3 – What’s your cloud-native vision for the .NET platform?
**Director-Level Answer**  
> A self-service, containerized platform where teams can provision, deploy, and observe microservices in minutes. Kubernetes with shared operators and standard CI/CD gives consistency without central bottlenecks.

**JPMC Alternative**  
> A governed PaaS for .NET—built on EKS with policy-as-code, service catalog, and embedded security controls. Developers get speed; Chase retains compliance and resilience.

**Drill-Down Details**  
* Reference architecture: GitHub Actions → ECR → EKS (Helm).  
* Observability: OpenTelemetry + Elastic APM.  
* Guardrails: OPA policies, resource quotas.  
* Metrics: service spin-up time ↓ from weeks to hours.

### Q4 – How do you manage technical debt during modernization?
**Director-Level Answer**  
> Maintain a living debt register, assign owners, and treat debt retirement as a deliverable. Use a 50/30/20 split: 50 % feature, 30 % debt, 20 % innovation.

**JPMC Alternative**  
> Debt items are logged in our risk register and tracked like control exceptions. Quarterly engineering review decides closure priority based on customer risk and cost of delay.

**Drill-Down Details**  
* Created “Debt Burndown Dashboard.”  
* Reduced critical debt by 40 % in 2 quarters.  
* Tied closure to OKRs and incentives.
