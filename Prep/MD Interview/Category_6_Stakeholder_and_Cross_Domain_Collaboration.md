# Category 6 – Stakeholder & Cross-Domain Collaboration

### Q1 – How do you influence senior stakeholders without authority?
**Director-Level Answer**  
> Build credibility through data and early wins. I translate tech risk into business impact and frame decisions in shared outcomes, not preferences.

**JPMC Alternative**  
> Influence comes from data-driven risk dialogues. We align on control objectives first, then decide implementation details collaboratively. Transparency builds trust.

**Drill-Down Details**  
* Example – won buy-in for APM adoption using incident data showing 30 % MTTR improvement.  
* Created exec-friendly dashboards translating tech KPIs to business uptime.

### Q2 – How do you align multiple domains to one architecture vision?
**Director-Level Answer**  
> Convene a cross-domain Architecture Board with shared principles. Set reference architectures, publish versioned APIs, and measure conformance via reviews.

**JPMC Alternative**  
> We run a Federated Architecture Council under the Enterprise Architecture office. Domains retain ownership but adhere to enterprise guardrails on security and resilience.

**Drill-Down Details**  
* Built architecture catalog in Backstage.  
* Conformance score ↑ from 60 → 95 %.  
* Quarterly architecture summits for alignment.
