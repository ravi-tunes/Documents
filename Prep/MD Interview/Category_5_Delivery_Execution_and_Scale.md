# Category 5 – Delivery, Execution & Scale

### Q1 – How do you ensure predictable delivery across many teams?
**Director-Level Answer**  
> Align teams through shared OKRs and cadence reviews. Transparency via dashboards prevents surprises. Escalate risks early through structured governance forums.

**JPMC Alternative**  
> We run quarterly PI planning with cross-domain dependency mapping and a central delivery scorecard visible to MD leadership. Predictability is a metric, not a promise.

**Drill-Down Details**  
* Delivery variance ↓ from 40 % → <10 %.  
* Used JIRA Portfolio for visibility.  
* Introduced “red-flag review” every fortnight.

### Q2 – How do you manage incidents and learn from them?
**Director-Level Answer**  
> Establish on-call rotations, post-incident reviews, and blameless culture. Categorize issues, assign preventive owners, track closure.

**JPMC Alternative**  
> We operate a formal Incident Lifecycle Framework integrated with ServiceNow. Every severity-1 has a root-cause analysis and action plan reviewed by Site Reliability Office.

**Drill-Down Details**  
* Mean incidents/month ↓ 35 %.  
* Introduced “Five Whys + Corrective Action Record”.  
* Knowledge-base articles auto-generated post RCA.

### Q3 – How do you ensure accountability without micromanaging?
**Director-Level Answer**  
> Use data as feedback instead of oversight. Each team owns metrics and presents progress in quarterly business reviews. My role is to enable, not intervene.

**JPMC Alternative**  
> We drive accountability through data-driven governance—engineering KPIs owned by teams but visible to leadership. Autonomy within transparency creates trust.

**Drill-Down Details**  
* 12 team scorecards auto-published monthly.  
* Reduced status meetings by 60 %.  
* Leadership trust index ↑ 25 pts.
