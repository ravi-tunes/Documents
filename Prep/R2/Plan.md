**30-60-90 Plan (Customized for TM & SP)**

0–30 Days: Discovery & Alignment

Goal: Build credibility, relationships, and a baseline of .NET maturity.
	•	Shadow Java governance council → understand patterns, metrics, and cadence.
	•	Meet all .NET suite owners (Flights, Lodging, Ground, etc.) → capture diversity in tools, versions, and processes.
	•	Inventory all .NET assets → framework versions, dependencies, CI/CD maturity, monitoring coverage, cloud readiness.
	•	Establish “Why Governance” narrative:
	•	Improved security/compliance (SP’s concern).
	•	Faster integration and scalability (TM’s concern).
	•	Consistency for cross-domain collaboration.

Deliverables:
	•	Current-state heatmap (.NET stack maturity).
	•	Summary of pain points + quick-win opportunities.

31–60 Days: Design and Propose

Goal: Define governance foundation and pilot modernization.
	•	Create .NET Engineering Playbook v1 (architecture, CI/CD, observability, auth, testing standards).
	•	Design reference architecture aligned with JPMC’s Java standards (REST, events, resilience, etc.).
	•	Pilot with one product suite (e.g., Lodging) — migrate one microservice to .NET 8 containerized with standardized CI/CD.
	•	Create governance council (CxLoyalty architects + Java architects + platform reps).
	•	Partner with SP’s team to embed:
	•	Security as code.
	•	Automated policy enforcement (linting, pipelines, IaC).

Deliverables:
	•	Approved Playbook draft + pilot POC.
	•	Governance Council charter.

---

61–90 Days: Institutionalize and Scale

Goal: Drive adoption, automation, and visibility.
	•	Launch Developer Enablement Portal: docs, templates, boilerplates, CI/CD blueprints.
	•	Automate compliance → integrate into pipelines (build fails if it violates governance).
	•	Define maturity scorecards (code quality, observability, resiliency).
	•	Roll out workshops and tech talks across CxLoyalty teams.
	•	Present progress dashboards to TM & SP: adoption rate, performance uplift, reduction in incidents.

Deliverables:
	•	Adoption metrics dashboard.
	•	Quarterly roadmap (migration & modernization).
	•	Recognition plan for high-performing teams.

📚 Critical Areas to Catch Up On (Before Interview)

1. Platform Governance Models
	•	Learn how large enterprises (e.g., Microsoft, ThoughtWorks, JPM) implement:
	•	Architecture Review Boards (ARBs)
	•	InnerSource patterns (shared libraries, templates)
	•	DevEx metrics (DORA metrics, developer onboarding time)

➡️ Study: “Team Topologies,” “Accelerate,” “Building Evolutionary Architectures.”

---

2. Cloud-Native .NET (for credibility with SP)
	•	Be fluent in:
	•	.NET 8 / ASP.NET Core architecture
	•	Docker + Kubernetes deployment models
	•	AWS ECS/EKS vs. Lambda tradeoffs
	•	Observability: Serilog, Elastic APM, OpenTelemetry
	•	AuthN/AuthZ: OAuth2, OpenID Connect, JWT

➡️ Focus: connecting these to platform governance and developer enablement.

---

3. Platform as a Product
	•	Treat governance like a developer product.
	•	Clear documentation, tooling, templates.
	•	Feedback loops.
	•	Metrics for “customer satisfaction” (internal devs).
	•	Reference: Spotify’s “Backstage” developer portal (many JPMC platform teams emulate this).

---

4. DevSecOps & Automation
	•	Speak confidently about:
	•	Policy-as-Code (OPA, Checkov, Conftest).
	•	Secure CI/CD (secrets management, static analysis gates).
	•	Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform) alignment.

SP will love hearing how you’d bake compliance into developer pipelines.

---

5. Stakeholder Management & Influence
	•	Practice stories of:
	•	Aligning federated teams without authority.
	•	Getting buy-in through pilots and proof points.
	•	Measuring adoption and business value.

💬 Likely Questions

From TM:
	•	“How would you define governance without slowing product teams?”
	•	“How will you unify multiple .NET teams with differing tech stacks?”
	•	“How would you align Java and .NET governance?”
	•	“What are the key modernization priorities you’d set in the first 6 months?”

From SP:
	•	“What’s your vision for a developer platform for .NET teams?”
	•	“How will you integrate security, compliance, and observability?”
	•	“How do you measure the success of a platform strategy?”
	•	“What automation would you prioritize first?”

🧠 Your Edge

Your resume already demonstrates:
	•	Cross-regional leadership and architecture governance (Barclays).
	•	Modernization from legacy to modular frameworks (C#/Java/Solace).
	•	DevOps maturity uplift (TeamCity automation, CI/CD).
	•	Deep distributed systems understanding.

Frame your experience as:

“I’ve done this before — modernized legacy tech and built governance from ground up in a complex, global environment. Now I want to do it at scale across Chase Travel.”
