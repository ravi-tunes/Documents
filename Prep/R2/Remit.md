1. Establishing .NET Governance and Standards
	‚Ä¢	JPMC‚Äôs Java side is already governed: mature architecture patterns, review boards, approved libraries, security/compliance baked in.
	‚Ä¢	The .NET side (via CxLoyalty acquisition) has been more federated and product-suite driven, meaning each team made its own choices.
	‚Ä¢	Your mandate will be to bring consistency, discipline, and long-term maintainability:
	‚Ä¢	Define enterprise-wide architectural blueprints for .NET (layering, microservices, APIs, integration standards).
	‚Ä¢	Publish approved technology stacks (e.g., .NET Core versions, logging frameworks, messaging libraries).
	‚Ä¢	Create guidelines for cross-cutting concerns (auth, observability, CI/CD pipelines, cloud readiness).
	‚Ä¢	Align this governance with what‚Äôs already working on the Java side, so that the firm has one enterprise-level strategy.

---

2. Transforming Teams and Product Suites
	‚Ä¢	You won‚Äôt just create documents ‚Äî you‚Äôll drive adoption.
	‚Ä¢	That means:
	‚Ä¢	Working with existing product teams (who are used to autonomy) and coaching them on why governance matters (stability, resilience, reduced tech debt).
	‚Ä¢	Setting up architecture councils or guilds where product architects can align with central strategy but still have a voice.
	‚Ä¢	Leading transformational programs ‚Äî e.g., migrating old .NET Framework apps to .NET Core, adopting common CI/CD, moving towards cloud-native readiness.
	‚Ä¢	Building metrics and accountability so teams see progress (e.g., percentage of services migrated to approved standards).

---

3. Bridging Java and .NET Worlds
	‚Ä¢	This isn‚Äôt about making .NET behave like Java, but about ensuring both follow consistent enterprise principles:
	‚Ä¢	Security and compliance (same rigor across stacks).
	‚Ä¢	Deployment and operational maturity (monitoring, SLOs, resilience).
	‚Ä¢	Integration patterns (APIs, messaging, service mesh).
	‚Ä¢	You‚Äôll act as the bridge between Java architects and .NET architects, ensuring consistency without killing productivity.
	‚Ä¢	Example: if Java services use a specific API gateway and logging framework, the .NET side should have a parallel standard, even if implementation differs.

---

4. Strategy and Influence at Director Level
	‚Ä¢	Act as the primary interface between senior leadership and the .NET product suite leaders.
	‚Ä¢	Translate strategy into execution: ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs why governance matters, here‚Äôs the roadmap, here‚Äôs how we measure success.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Balance innovation vs. standardization ‚Äî product teams should still innovate, but within guardrails that align to firmwide goals.
	‚Ä¢	Build the culture: move from ‚Äúevery team for itself‚Äù to ‚Äúshared ownership of a platform.‚Äù

---

5. Execution Outcomes You‚Äôll Be Measured On
	‚Ä¢	A clear architecture playbook for .NET (aligned to enterprise Java playbook).
	‚Ä¢	Reduced fragmentation across .NET products (fewer duplicate libraries, less rework).
	‚Ä¢	Migration of legacy .NET apps to modern .NET Core/cloud-native setups.
	‚Ä¢	Uplift in operational maturity: better observability, resilience, security in production systems.
	‚Ä¢	Cross-team alignment: .NET teams working with Java teams under one governance umbrella.

---

üëâ In short:
This role is about creating the strategy, governance, and execution framework to bring .NET (via CxLoyalty) up to the same level of maturity as JPMC‚Äôs Java landscape ‚Äî and then transforming people, products, and processes to adopt it.

**30-60-90 Day Plan (Director ‚Äì Platform Strategy, .NET Governance)**

First 30 Days ‚Äì Understand & Assess
	‚Ä¢	Listen and Learn
	‚Ä¢	Meet Java governance leaders to understand their patterns, standards, review processes, and boards.
	‚Ä¢	Meet CxLoyalty (.NET product-suite) leaders to understand current architecture, decision-making autonomy, and pain points.
	‚Ä¢	Map the Landscape
	‚Ä¢	Inventory all .NET product suites: tech stacks (.NET Framework vs .NET Core), hosting environments, CI/CD tooling, observability, auth/security models.
	‚Ä¢	Document overlaps, inconsistencies, and risks (e.g., multiple logging frameworks, fragmented deployment strategies).
	‚Ä¢	Stakeholder Alignment
	‚Ä¢	Build relationships with MDs, product heads, and tech leads. Communicate that governance will enable productivity, not stifle it.
	‚Ä¢	Socialize the vision: ‚ÄúConsistency, Resilience, Alignment with Java best practices.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Quick Wins
	‚Ä¢	Identify 1‚Äì2 ‚Äúlow hanging fruit‚Äù (e.g., standardize observability tools like Elastic APM across .NET, or align on a preferred CI/CD framework).

---

Day 31‚Äì60 ‚Äì Define & Propose
	‚Ä¢	Governance Blueprint
	‚Ä¢	Draft .NET Architecture Playbook: standards for layering, API design, logging, auth, resiliency, cloud readiness.
	‚Ä¢	Align blueprint with Java governance (so execs see one enterprise strategy).
	‚Ä¢	Pilot Transformation
	‚Ä¢	Pick one product suite to pilot modernization (e.g., migrating a service from .NET Framework ‚Üí .NET Core, containerizing it, applying new CI/CD + observability).
	‚Ä¢	Use it as a proof point to show value.
	‚Ä¢	Structure & Operating Model
	‚Ä¢	Propose architecture councils/guilds: product architects + central platform strategy.
	‚Ä¢	Define review processes: when teams must come for architecture review, how exceptions are handled.
	‚Ä¢	Talent & Culture
	‚Ä¢	Identify .NET architects/SMEs who can act as governance champions.
	‚Ä¢	Start coaching product teams on why governance matters (reduced tech debt, resilience, easier integration).

Critical Skills/Knowledge to Catch Up On

This role is more platform strategy + governance than deep IC coding. To excel, you need to quickly shore up on:

1. Governance & Enterprise Architecture Patterns
	‚Ä¢	How large enterprises run architecture review boards, guilds, playbooks, standards catalogs.
	‚Ä¢	Focus on soft power: influencing adoption in federated teams.
	‚Ä¢	Reading: TOGAF, Enterprise Architecture at Scale, case studies on federated governance.

2. Modern .NET Core Ecosystem
	‚Ä¢	Brush up on .NET 6/7 features, ASP.NET Core hosting, dependency injection, EF Core, gRPC/REST best practices.
	‚Ä¢	Deployment in containers (Docker + Kubernetes).
	‚Ä¢	Authentication/authorization with JWT, OAuth2, OpenID Connect.
	‚Ä¢	Resources: Microsoft Learn cloud-native .NET track.

3. Cloud-Native & DevOps Practices
	‚Ä¢	Kubernetes orchestration, service mesh basics (Istio/Linkerd).
	‚Ä¢	Cloud-native resilience patterns (circuit breakers, retries, rate limiting).
	‚Ä¢	CI/CD frameworks in modern .NET (Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions).

4. Influencing & Transformation Leadership
	‚Ä¢	Coaching autonomous teams used to making their own decisions.
	‚Ä¢	Techniques: storytelling (show how governance reduces outages), piloting (prove by example), recognition (celebrate teams who adopt standards).
	‚Ä¢	Read: Team Topologies, The Art of Scalability.

5. Cross-Stack Alignment
	‚Ä¢	You‚Äôll need to translate Java governance into .NET equivalents:
	‚Ä¢	If Java uses Spring Boot + Splunk logging, find the .NET Core analog (Serilog, Elastic).
	‚Ä¢	If Java uses Maven + Jenkins pipelines, align with .NET Core equivalents (NuGet + Azure DevOps).
