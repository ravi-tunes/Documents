### 1. Managing Managers
**Question:** Describe your philosophy for managing and developing other leaders. Can you tell me about a time you had to coach a new manager who was struggling with the transition?

**Answer:**
"My philosophy for managing managers is to provide 'aligned autonomy.' I set a clear vision and strategic goals—the 'what' and 'why'—and then empower my managers to determine the 'how.' My role shifts from a director to a coach. My 1:1s are focused on their challenges, their team's health, and removing organizational roadblocks, not project status updates.

I had a situation with a top principal engineer we promoted to Engineering Manager.
*   **Situation:** About three months in, his team's velocity had dropped, and I was hearing whispers of frustration. He was still the first person to jump on every technical problem, becoming a bottleneck and effectively disempowering his senior engineers. He was trying to be the hero, not the leader.
*   **Task:** My goal was to help him transition his identity from an individual problem-solver to a team multiplier.
*   **Action:** In our next 1:1, I laid out the observations and data I had. I reframed his role by asking him, 'What is the one thing that only you can do for your team?' We realized it wasn't writing code; it was setting context, managing stakeholders, and growing his engineers. We created a concrete 30-day plan: he had to delegate all code reviews to his tech lead, spend 50% of his time pairing with and mentoring his team members, and have a career conversation with each of them.
*   **Result:** It was a difficult transition for him, but it worked. He saw that by stepping back, his team stepped up. Their ownership and output increased dramatically. A year later, he became one of our most effective managers, known for developing incredible talent. My biggest learning was that you have to actively coach new managers on *letting go*."

### 2. Upward Management & Influence
**Question:** Describe a situation where you had to present a high-risk, high-reward technology strategy to senior leadership that required significant investment.

**Answer:**
"In my previous role, our platform was hosted entirely in an on-premise data center. I proposed a two-year migration to the public cloud.
*   **Situation:** This was a high-risk, multi-million dollar proposal. The reward was a projected 40% reduction in infrastructure costs and, more importantly, a radical acceleration in our ability to ship software. Leadership was skeptical of the disruption and the upfront cost.
*   **Task:** I needed to build a rock-solid business case and get buy-in from not just the CTO, but also the CFO and the head of the business unit, who were my key stakeholders.
*   **Action:** I knew a single slide deck wouldn't cut it. I treated it as an internal strategic campaign.
    1.  **I built a coalition:** I didn't frame it as a 'tech project.' I partnered with a leader from Finance to build the TCO model and a director from Product to quantify the value of increased deployment speed in terms of business opportunities.
    2.  **I conducted a 'roadshow':** Before the formal executive review, my partners and I held 1:1 meetings with each key stakeholder. This allowed us to surface and address their specific concerns—security for the CISO, financial controls for the CFO—in a low-pressure setting.
    3.  **I tailored the message:** In the final presentation, I spoke their language. For the CFO, I led with the move from CapEx to OpEx and the long-term cost savings. For the business head, I led with speed-to-market and competitive advantage.
*   **Result:** By the time we had the final meeting, the decision was already made. The proposal was approved with full support because we had done the work to build consensus and de-risk the decision for each stakeholder. The project was a success and became a blueprint for other divisions."

### 3. Navigating Conflict in a Matrixed Organization
**Question:** Tell me about a time you had a significant disagreement with a peer leader over project priorities or technical direction. How did you navigate that conflict?

**Answer:**
"In a matrixed organization, influence is everything. I had a situation where my peer, the Director of the central SRE organization, wanted to enforce a new, very restrictive deployment policy that my teams felt would dramatically slow them down.
*   **Situation:** His team was incentivized by stability above all else; my teams were incentivized by feature velocity. We were at a stalemate. The tension was high, and our teams were starting to see each other as adversaries.
*   **Task:** My goal was to find a solution that met his stability requirements without crippling my teams' ability to deliver value to customers quickly.
*   **Action:**
    1.  **I depersonalized the conflict:** I scheduled a 1:1 with him and started by saying, 'I think we both want the same thing: a stable, successful product for our customers. It seems we just have different perspectives on the best way to get there.' This reframed it as a shared problem, not a personal fight.
    2.  **I focused on data, not anecdotes:** My teams *felt* the new policy would be slow. I asked them to quantify it. We ran an analysis showing it would add three days to our average deployment lead time. I brought this data to my peer.
    3.  **I proposed a compromise:** I suggested a 'paved road' model. For teams deploying services that met a certain high standard of automated testing and observability (our most mature teams), they could use a more streamlined deployment process. For less mature services, the stricter SRE checks would apply.
*   **Result:** He agreed. This solution allowed him to meet his stability goals by focusing SRE attention where it was most needed, and it gave my teams a clear, incentivized path to earn more autonomy. We turned a conflict into a collaboration that made our entire system better."

### 4. Team Building and Culture
**Question:** The job description mentions championing diversity, equity, and inclusion. How do you actively build an inclusive culture?

**Answer:**
"Championing DE&I is a core leadership responsibility, and it has to be addressed systemically. I focus my efforts on three areas:

1.  **Hiring and Recruiting (Bringing People In):** I work with recruiting to ensure we have diverse candidate pools. More importantly, I institutionalize inclusive hiring practices. This includes training on unconscious bias for all interviewers, using structured interview questions to ensure every candidate is evaluated on the same criteria, and requiring diverse interview panels. It's about leveling the playing field for everyone.
2.  **Inclusion and Belonging (Making People Feel Valued):** A diverse team is useless if people don't feel they can be their authentic selves. I foster psychological safety by modeling vulnerability as a leader and by creating processes that encourage all voices to be heard, such as rotating meeting facilitators or using written feedback rounds before a decision is made. I also have zero tolerance for non-inclusive behavior and act on it immediately.
3.  **Growth and Equity (Making People Succeed):** This is the most critical part. I periodically review promotion data, compensation, and the allocation of high-visibility 'stretch' projects across my organization to ensure it's equitable. I make sure our mentorship programs are reaching everyone, and I actively sponsor high-potential individuals from underrepresented backgrounds to help them navigate the organization and get to the next level.

For me, DE&I isn't a separate initiative; it's a filter through which I make all my talent-related decisions."

### 5. Strategic Planning & Budgeting
**Question:** How would you approach developing a technology roadmap and budget for an organization of 50-70 engineers?

**Answer:**
"My approach is a collaborative, year-round process that directly links our technology investments to business outcomes.

1.  **Strategic Alignment (The 'Why'):** The process begins by working with my Product and Business partners to deeply understand the firm's strategic objectives for the next 12-18 months. We distill these into a set of measurable key results for our product area.
2.  **Bottom-Up & Top-Down Inputs (The 'What'):** I then run two parallel streams of work. My engineering managers work with their teams to generate a 'bottom-up' list of needs: critical tech debt, architectural runway projects (like the cloud migration), and tooling improvements. Simultaneously, Product develops a 'top-down' list of new business initiatives.
3.  **Capacity Allocation & Prioritization (The 'How'):** I don't believe in a 100% feature-focused roadmap. I advocate for a clear capacity allocation model, for example: 60% for new business initiatives, 30% for foundational tech work, and 10% for unplanned work. We then take all the proposed initiatives and force-rank them within those buckets based on value, cost, and risk.
4.  **Budgeting and Headcount (The 'Who'):** The budget is a direct output of this prioritized roadmap. I justify headcount not by saying 'I need five engineers,' but by saying, 'To deliver on the top three prioritized business initiatives, we need one more team. If we cannot fund that team, we must all agree that initiative number three moves off the roadmap.' This frames the conversation around business trade-offs, making the budgeting process much more strategic and transparent."
