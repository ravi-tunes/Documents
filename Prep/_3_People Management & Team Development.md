# Interview Prep: Director of Software Engineering (JPMC)
## Theme: People Management & Team Development

### Introduction: How to Use This Guide
This document is a preparation tool, not a script. The goal is to understand the *intent* behind each question and to structure your personal experiences into compelling narratives using the **STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result)** method. The difference between a "Good Answer" and a "Best Response" lies in demonstrating strategic thinking, proactive leadership, and a deep sense of ownership for your team's culture and growth.

---

### Question 1: "Walk me through your philosophy on developing engineering managers. How do you coach a new manager differently from an experienced one?"
> <font color="red">New Manager: Talk about my struggle when I transitioned from IC to Manager. How you got mentored, how you learned effective 1:1, team velocity, letting go of the code, etc
Senior Manager: Increase remit and influence. Get them involved in wider initiatives. Expand scope beyond their team.</font> 

#### What's Really Being Asked (The Evaluation):
*   Do you have a deliberate, repeatable framework for growing leaders?
*   Do you understand that management is a distinct and difficult skill set, separate from engineering?
*   Can you demonstrate your experience as a "manager of managers"?
*   Do you adapt your coaching style to the individual's needs and experience level?

#### Structuring Your Answer:
1.  **State your core philosophy:** Start with a concise, memorable statement about what you believe leadership development is about.
2.  **Address New Managers:** Detail your approach for the IC-to-manager transition. Focus on foundational, tactical skills.
3.  **Address Experienced Managers:** Detail your approach for scaling their impact. Focus on strategic and organizational leadership.
4.  **Provide concrete examples:** Use a brief STAR-method story for each type of manager.

---

#### A Good Answer (Level 1 - Competent):
"My philosophy is that great managers create an environment where engineers can do their best work. For a new manager, my focus is on the tactical shift. I coach them on the fundamentals: how to run effective 1:1s, give constructive feedback, delegate tasks instead of doing them, and shield the team from distractions.

For an experienced manager, the coaching shifts from tactical execution to strategic impact. We work on things like headcount planning, influencing product roadmaps, managing budgets, and developing the next generation of leaders on their own teams."

---

#### The Best Response (Level 2 - Strategic & Proactive):
"My philosophy is to grow managers from excellent tactical leaders into strategic organizational force-multipliers. I follow a 'Situational Leadership' model, adapting my approach based on their specific needs, but the focus is always on scaling their influence and impact.

**For a new manager**, just promoted from a Senior IC role, my initial goal is to help them navigate the identity shift.
*   **Situation:** I had a new manager, 'Alex,' who was still trying to be the top technical expert and was burning out by reviewing every line of code.
*   **Task:** My task was to coach him to trust his team and transition from a 'doer' to a 'delegator and enabler.'
*   **Action:** We set up a formal 30-60-90 day plan. We role-played difficult feedback conversations, I reviewed his 1:1 notes with him, and we set a clear goal that he would not personally commit any code for the first quarter. Instead, his primary metrics were team velocity and team health, which we measured via DORA metrics and short surveys.
*   **Result:** Within two quarters, Alex was operating as a true manager. His team's morale and output increased because they felt more ownership, and he was able to focus on unblocking them and coordinating with other teams.

**For an experienced manager**, my coaching is focused on expanding their scope beyond their immediate team.
*   **Situation:** I had a seasoned manager, 'Sarah,' who was excellent at execution but rarely contributed to strategy outside her own domain.
*   **Task:** I needed her to start thinking and acting like a Director-level leader to help shape our department's future.
*   **Action:** I made her my delegate in director-level roadmap planning meetings. We worked together on a proposal for a new platform initiative, which required her to build a business case, collaborate with three other teams, and present a multi-year budget. I coached her on navigating stakeholder relationships and tying her technical vision to business KPIs.
*   **Result:** Sarah successfully got the initiative funded and is now leading that cross-functional effort. She grew from managing a team to leading an entire program, which is the exact kind of scaling I aim to develop in my leaders."

### Question 2: "Describe a time you had to manage an underperforming manager on your team. What was the situation, what steps did you take, and what was the outcome?"
> <font color="red">Talk about Kashish who was not performing because he was stuck in Cadet and not contributing to LC stream.</font> 

#### What's Really Being Asked (The Evaluation):
*   Can you handle difficult conversations with empathy and directness?
*   Do you follow a fair and documented process?
*   Do you understand your responsibility to both the individual *and* the team they lead?
*   Are you willing to make tough decisions when necessary?

---

#### A Good Answer (Level 1 - Competent):
"I had a manager whose team was consistently missing deadlines. I first spoke with them to understand their perspective. I gave them specific, actionable feedback on where they were falling short, like not having a clear project plan. We put a plan in place, and I checked in weekly. Unfortunately, performance didn't improve, and we ultimately had to part ways. It was a difficult decision, but it was the right one for the business."

---

#### The Best Response (Level 2 - Fair, Thorough, & Team-Centric):
"Protecting a team from poor leadership is one of my most critical responsibilities.

*   **Situation:** I inherited a team where morale was visibly low and attrition was high. Through skip-level 1:1s, I gathered feedback that their manager, 'John,' was a poor communicator, frequently changed priorities, and took credit for the team's successes while blaming them for failures. The delivery metrics confirmed thisâ€”their project was significantly behind schedule.
*   **Task:** My task was twofold: first, to give John a fair and clear opportunity to improve, and second, to stabilize the team and prevent further attrition.
*   **Action:**
    1.  **Data Collection:** I consolidated the anonymous feedback and the project data into specific, behavioral examples.
    2.  **Direct Feedback:** I sat down with John and presented the data, focusing on the *impact* of his actions (e.g., "When priorities change daily without context, it erodes trust and makes engineers feel their work isn't valued").
    3.  **Performance Improvement Plan (PIP):** This was not a punitive step, but a supportive one. We co-created a 60-day PIP with clear, measurable goals: He had to publish a weekly team roadmap, implement a blameless post-mortem process, and I would join his team meetings to observe his communication style. We met twice a week to review progress.
    4.  **Team Support:** In parallel, I met with the team's tech lead to ensure the technical work stayed on track, and I reassured the team that their feedback was being heard and acted upon.
*   **Result:** Unfortunately, despite the coaching, John was unable to make the fundamental behavioral changes required. After the 60 days, we mutually agreed that the role was not a good fit, and we managed a professional exit. I then took over as interim manager for the team, re-established trust and stability, and eventually promoted the team's Tech Lead into the manager role. While losing a manager is never ideal, the process was fair, documented, and the team's health and productivity improved dramatically within the next quarter."

### Question 3: "How do you identify and grow top talent? Give me an example of someone you mentored who went on to a significantly more senior role."
> <font color="red"> Talk about sudeep and how I got him up the value chain and finally promoted him to VP.</font> 

#### What's Really Being Asked (The Evaluation):
*   Do you look beyond just technical skill when identifying 'top talent'?
*   Are you proactive in creating growth opportunities, or do you wait for people to ask?
*   Do you have a repeatable model for mentorship and sponsorship?
*   Is your success measured, in part, by the success of the people you lead?

---

#### A Good Answer (Level 1 - Competent):
"I look for engineers who have strong technical skills and great potential. I identify them and give them challenging projects to help them grow. I had a great engineer who I mentored, and they eventually got promoted to a senior role. I just made sure they were working on impactful things and gave them advice when they needed it."

---

#### The Best Response (Level 2 - Proactive & Deliberate):
"I believe top talent is a combination of technical excellence, high ownership, and the ability to make everyone around them better. My role is to identify that potential and then create a path for it to flourish.

*   **Situation:** I had a Senior Engineer, 'Maria,' on one of my teams. She was technically brilliant but quiet in meetings and rarely sought the spotlight. However, I noticed in code reviews and 1:1s that she was an incredible mentor to junior engineers and often had the most insightful architectural ideas.
*   **Task:** My goal was to grow her into a Principal Engineer, which required her to demonstrate influence beyond her immediate team.
*   **Action:** We created a formal development plan together.
    1.  **Visibility:** I started by asking her to lead the technical design discussion for a new service in our weekly architecture guild meeting. We prepped for it together so she felt confident.
    2.  **Sponsorship:** I then sponsored her to be the primary technical representative for our entire department on a major cross-bank security initiative. This gave her exposure to senior leaders and forced her to think about problems at an enterprise scale.
    3.  **Mentorship:** We formalized her mentorship role, making her the official onboarding buddy and technical coach for all new hires on the team.
*   **Result:** Over the course of 18 months, Maria's confidence and influence grew immensely. Her performance in the security initiative was so strong that she was recognized by a Managing Director. When a Principal Engineer role opened up, she was the obvious choice. She is now one of the top technical leaders in our organization, and I consider her success a direct reflection of my commitment to growing talent."

### Question 4: "How do you structure your teams for a new, large-scale project? What principles do you follow for team composition and autonomy?"
> <font color="red"> Talk about 2 ways. 
Older inefficient way of having 1 large team with fungable devs. Pros: fungable cons: no sense of ownership
New: Base it on the context and the business domain and value streams. Give example of Reference stream that takes care of all Static data (Ingress, quality, etc)
Also talk about 2 extra teams. DevOps to make sure that all the streams follows the same standardized pattern, lets devs concentrate on functional deliverables. Also if possible an eng/platform team if you can identify a common technical foundation.</font> 

#### What's Really Being Asked (The Evaluation):
*   Do you understand organizational design principles like Conway's Law?
*   Can you connect team structure to business goals and technical architecture?
*   How do you balance top-down direction with bottom-up team autonomy?
*   Do you think about how teams will communicate and collaborate?

---

#### The Best Response (Level 2 - Strategic & Systems-Thinking):
"My primary principle for team structure is to **organize around business domains and value streams, not technology layers.** This is a direct application of Conway's Lawâ€”we design our organization to mirror the architecture we want to build.

For a new, large-scale project like the Travel Platform, my approach would be:
1.  **Domain-Driven Design (DDD) First:** Before writing a line of code, I would work with Product and Architecture to map out the bounded contexts of the system. For a travel platform, this might be 'Search & Booking,' 'User Accounts & Loyalty,' 'Partner Integrations,' and 'Payment & Fulfillment.'
2.  **Create Domain-Oriented Teams:** Each bounded context would be owned by a single, durable 'two-pizza team.' This team would be cross-functional, containing engineers, a product owner, a designer, and embedded QA. They would have full ownership of their microservices, from cradle to grave.
3.  **Define the 'Paved Road':** To grant autonomy without creating chaos, my platform/SRE teams would build a 'paved road.' This includes a standardized CI/CD pipeline, observability tools, security scanners, and cloud infrastructure templates. Teams are free to solve their business problems however they see fit, as long as they stay on the paved road. This ensures consistency and quality.
4.  **Establish Clear Communication Contracts:** We would establish a Guild or 'Team of Teams' structure for cross-cutting concerns. For example, a weekly 'API Guild' meeting would allow teams to coordinate on their public API contracts, and a 'Frontend Guild' would maintain our shared component library. This avoids silos while maintaining clear ownership.

This structure minimizes cognitive load on any single team, reduces dependencies, and empowers them to deliver business value quickly and independently."

### Question 5: "The job description mentions championing diversity, equity, and inclusion. Can you provide a specific example of how you have built or nurtured a diverse and inclusive team environment?"
> <font color="red"> D: Not much experience as the team is already Diverse
For I: Talk about how you got Sudeep to delegate status update to his team members which gave even junior devs visibility and pride in their work.</font> 

#### What's Really Being Asked (The Evaluation):
*   Is DEI just a buzzword to you, or is it something you actively practice?
*   Can you provide concrete actions you have taken, not just beliefs you hold?
*   How do you ensure fairness in hiring, promotions, and day-to-day interactions?
*   Do you understand that an inclusive culture is a prerequisite for a diverse team to thrive?

---

#### The Best Response (Level 2 - Action-Oriented & Authentic):
"Championing DEI is a continuous action, not a one-time goal. For me, it boils down to two key areas: building a diverse team and ensuring that team is inclusive.

**On building a diverse team:**
*   **Action:** I completely overhauled my previous team's hiring process. We stopped relying solely on referrals, which often sourced from the same networks. I partnered with my firm's DEI groups to advertise roles in new communities and mandated that every interview panel be diverse. We also standardized our interview questions and used a structured scoring rubric to reduce unconscious bias in the evaluation process.
*   **Result:** Over the next year, we increased the representation of women on our team from 15% to 35% and hired our first two engineers from a non-traditional coding bootcamp background.

**On fostering an inclusive environment (which is even more important):**
*   **Action:** I noticed in team meetings that the same few people tended to dominate the conversation. To ensure all voices were heard, I implemented a 'silent brainstorming' technique for design sessions. We'd spend the first 10 minutes with everyone writing their ideas down in a shared document *before* any discussion. Then, we would go around the room and have each person, including the most junior members, share their top idea.
*   **Result:** This simple process change was transformative. It gave introverted team members a platform to contribute and dramatically improved the quality and creativity of our solutions because we were tapping into the entire team's intelligence. It sent a clear message that every perspective was valued, which is the foundation of an inclusive culture."
