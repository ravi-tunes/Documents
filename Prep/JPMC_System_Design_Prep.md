# Interview Prep: Director of Software Engineering (JPMC)
## Category 2: System Design & Architecture (Whiteboard Round)

### Introduction: How to Approach the Whiteboard
As a Director, your role is to guide the conversation, clarify ambiguity, and build a high-level vision before diving deep. Start by asking questions. State your assumptions. Talk about the *why* before the *what*. Use this guide as a framework for your narrative, inserting your own experiences and style.

---

## Prompt 1: Greenfield Design - "Design a new, global Travel Rewards Platform."

**(This is how you might begin the conversation...)**

"Great, this is a fantastic and challenging problem. Before I start drawing boxes and arrows, I want to make sure I understand the core business goals and constraints. My initial clarifying questions would be:

*   **Business Goals:** What is the primary business driver? Is it to increase credit card user engagement, create a new revenue stream, or compete directly with players like AmEx Travel? This will influence our trade-offs.
*   **Scope (MVP vs. Long-Term):** Are we designing the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to launch in 6 months, or the long-term vision for 3 years from now? Let's assume we're designing the scalable foundation for the long-term vision.
*   **Users & Scale:** Who are the users? Just JPMC cardholders? Will it be open to the public? Are we expecting 1 million active users or 50 million? This impacts our database choices and scaling strategy.
*   **Global Aspect:** What does "global" mean? Multi-language support? Multi-currency? Regional partner integrations and data residency requirements (like GDPR)? Let's assume yes to all three.
*   **Core Features:** I'll assume the core features are: searching for flights/hotels/cars, booking with points/cash/hybrid, managing user profiles and loyalty points, and integrating with third-party travel providers."

**(Once you have clarity, you can proceed with the design.)**

"Okay, thank you. Based on that, I'll architect a system optimized for scalability, resilience, and evolvability. My guiding principle will be **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, allowing us to build a system that mirrors the business and can be scaled by organizing our teams around it."

### Key Probing Area 1: High-Level Architecture

My high-level architecture is a **distributed system of microservices, orchestrated via an event-driven backbone**, with a clear separation between the user-facing experience and the backend domains.

*(At this point, you'd draw on the whiteboard a C4-style diagram)*

1.  **Clients:** Web (React/Angular) and Mobile (iOS/Android) clients.
2.  **API Gateway:** A single, secure entry point for all client traffic. It handles concerns like authentication, rate limiting, and request routing to the appropriate downstream services.
3.  **Backend Microservices (The Bounded Contexts):** I'd break the problem down into logical business domains, each owned by an independent service:
    *   **User & Profile Service:** Manages all user data, authentication, preferences, and loyalty status.
    *   **Loyalty & Points Ledger Service:** The source of truth for all points transactions. This is a financial-grade service, requiring high consistency and an immutable ledger for auditing (e.g., 'Earn 1000 points,' 'Redeem 5000 points').
    *   **Partner Integration Service:** A set of adapters responsible for communicating with external partner APIs (Airlines via GDS like Sabre, Hotel Chains, etc.). This isolates the messy, inconsistent external world from our clean internal domain.
    *   **Search & Aggregation Service:** Handles complex search queries. It aggregates real-time data from the Partner Integration Service, caches it, and provides fast search results. This service is optimized for high read throughput.
    *   **Booking & Fulfillment Service:** Manages the complex, multi-step booking workflow (the 'Saga' pattern would be appropriate here). It coordinates with the Points Ledger, Payments, and Partner services to complete a booking.
    *   **Notifications Service:** Manages all user communications (email, SMS, push notifications) for things like booking confirmations and flight alerts.
4.  **Event Streaming Platform (e.g., Kafka):** This is the central nervous system. Services communicate asynchronously by publishing events (e.g., `BookingCompleted`, `PointsEarned`). This decouples the services, increases resilience (if the Notification service is down, the Booking service can still succeed), and allows for future services (like a Data Analytics service) to easily subscribe to the event stream.

### Key Probing Area 2: Technology Choices

My choices prioritize performance, security, and leveraging the existing talent pool and enterprise standards at JPMC, while using modern, cloud-native technologies.

*   **Backend Language/Framework:** **.NET Core (now .NET 8+)**. The job description requires it, and it's an excellent choice. It's high-performance, cross-platform (critical for containers), has a robust ecosystem for enterprise development, and JPMC likely has a deep talent pool.
*   **Databases (Polyglot Persistence):** We'll use the right database for the right job.
    *   **User, Booking, and Ledger Services:** **PostgreSQL or SQL Server**. These services demand strong transactional consistency (ACID). A relational database is the perfect fit.
    *   **Search & Aggregation Service:** **Elasticsearch or a NoSQL Document DB like MongoDB/DynamoDB**. This service needs to handle flexible data from many providers and provide fast, complex querying capabilities.
    *   **Caching:** **Redis**. For caching partner search results, user sessions, and rate-limiting data in the API Gateway.
*   **Event Streaming:** **Apache Kafka** (or a managed cloud equivalent like AWS MSK / Confluent Cloud). It's the industry standard for high-throughput, durable event streaming.
*   **API Gateway:** **A managed cloud provider gateway (e.g., AWS API Gateway)** or a self-hosted solution like **Kong**.

### Key Probing Area 3: Cloud-Native Principles

We will design and build this platform to be cloud-native from day one. This isn't just about running in the cloud; it's about leveraging its capabilities.

*   **Containerization & Orchestration:** All microservices will be packaged as **Docker containers** and deployed on a **Kubernetes** cluster (e.g., AWS EKS, Azure AKS). This provides portability, declarative scaling, and automated health checks and restarts.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** We will have a mature, automated pipeline for every service. A push to `main` will trigger a workflow that:
    1.  Builds the code.
    2.  Runs static analysis and unit/integration tests.
    3.  Performs security scans (SAST, DAST, dependency checking).
    4.  Builds and pushes the container image to a registry.
    5.  Deploys automatically to a staging environment for end-to-end testing.
    6.  Promotes to production using a **Canary or Blue-Green deployment strategy** to eliminate downtime and reduce risk.
*   **Observability (The Three Pillars):** You can't run what you can't see.
    *   **Logging:** Centralized logging using the **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** or a service like Splunk. Logs will be structured (JSON) for easy querying.
    *   **Metrics:** Instrument all services using a library like **Prometheus**. We'll have dashboards in **Grafana** to monitor system health (latency, error rates, throughput - the RED metrics) and business KPIs.
    *   **Tracing:** Implement distributed tracing using **OpenTelemetry**. This is crucial in a microservices world to trace a single user request as it flows through multiple services, allowing us to pinpoint bottlenecks.

### Key Probing Area 4: Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

For a financial services travel platform, these are as important as the features themselves.

*   **Security:** This is paramount. We'll have a multi-layered approach:
    *   **Authentication & Authorization:** Use **OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect** for secure authentication. The API Gateway will enforce authorization, ensuring users can only access their own data.
    *   **Data Protection:** All data will be **encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest**. We'll have strict PII handling policies and data masking.
    *   **Compliance:** We will design for **PCI DSS compliance** from the start for any payment processing and be mindful of **GDPR** for data residency.
*   **Scalability & Resilience:**
    *   All services will be stateless and horizontally scalable via Kubernetes.
    *   We will design for failure using patterns like **retries with exponential backoff and circuit breakers** in inter-service communication.
    *   For disaster recovery, the entire platform will be deployed across **multiple availability zones**, and critical data stores will be replicated across regions.

---

### Key Probing Area 5: Organizational Structure

This is a key part of my role as a Director. **Conway's Law** dictates that our organizational structure will shape our software architecture, so we must be intentional.

*   **Team Structure:** We will create **Domain-Oriented, Stream-Aligned Teams**. Each team will be a long-lived, cross-functional unit (5-8 engineers, a Product Owner, a designer) that has **full end-to-end ownership** of one of the microservices (e.g., the 'Loyalty Team' owns the Points Ledger service).
*   **Enabling Teams:** To support these stream-aligned teams and avoid reinventing the wheel, we will have a few **Platform/Enabling Teams:**
    *   **SRE/Platform Team:** Owns the Kubernetes platform, CI/CD pipeline, and observability tools (the 'paved road').
    *   **Data Platform Team:** Manages the Kafka cluster and data warehousing infrastructure.
*   **This structure promotes autonomy, ownership, and clear accountability, allowing us to scale the organization as we scale the product.**

## Prompt 2: Modernization Strategy - "Modernize a 10-year-old, monolithic travel portal."

**(This is how you might begin the conversation...)**

"This is a very common and critical challenge. A 'big bang' rewrite is almost always a mistake—it's incredibly risky, expensive, and delivers no value to customers until it's 100% complete.

Therefore, my strategy is an **evolutionary, incremental modernization** focused on safely strangling the monolith piece by piece, while continuing to deliver business value throughout the process. My guiding principles for this initiative would be:

1.  **Minimize Risk:** Every step must be small, reversible, and validated.
2.  **Deliver Value Incrementally:** The business can't wait two years for a new platform. We need to unlock new capabilities as we go.
3.  **Improve Developer Experience:** A key goal is to make our engineers' lives better, which will naturally increase velocity and quality."

### My Modernization Strategy: The Strangler Fig Pattern

I would implement the **Strangler Fig Pattern**, a well-established method for migrating legacy systems. We will build new functionality as external microservices and gradually intercept and route traffic from the old monolith to the new services, until the monolith is eventually "strangled" and can be decommissioned.

This is a multi-phase, multi-year journey.

#### **Phase 0: Stop the Bleeding & Prepare the Ground (First 3-6 Months)**

Before we build anything new, we must stabilize the existing system and create a safety net.
1.  **Improve Observability:** We can't safely change what we can't see. We'll add detailed monitoring, logging, and alerting to the monolith to understand its current behavior and performance.
2.  **Build a CI/CD Pipeline:** We'll get the existing monolith into a reliable, automated build and deployment pipeline. This reduces the risk of every single change.
3.  **Create a Test Safety Net:** We'll invest heavily in writing high-level, end-to-end integration and contract tests around the parts of the system we intend to change first. This ensures we don't break existing functionality as we start carving pieces off.

#### **Phase 1: The First Seam & The Strangler Façade (Next 6-9 Months)**

1.  **Identify the First Bounded Context to Strangle:** We'll choose our first target carefully. The ideal candidate is a domain with minimal dependencies and high business value. A great example would be the **User Profile Management** section. It's relatively self-contained.
2.  **Build the First Microservice:** We will build a brand new, cloud-native **User Profile Service** using **.NET Core** and deploy it on **Kubernetes**.
3.  **Deploy the 'Strangler Façade' (API Gateway / Proxy):** We will place an API Gateway or a reverse proxy in front of the monolith. Initially, it will just pass all traffic through to the monolith.
4.  **Route the First Endpoint:** We will re-route the `/api/users` endpoints to our new `UserProfile` service. All other traffic still flows to the monolith.
5.  **Data Synchronization:** This is the hardest part. We'll need a mechanism to keep data in sync between the monolith's database and the new service's database during the transition. This could involve dual-writes, or preferably, an event-based approach where changes in one database publish an event that the other system consumes.

#### **Phase 2: Accelerate & Repeat (Ongoing)**

Once we've proven the pattern with the first service, we have a repeatable blueprint. We can now parallelize the effort:
*   Identify the next bounded contexts to strangle (e.g., Search, then Bookings).
*   Form dedicated teams for each new microservice.
*   Continue to carve off functionality, routing more and more traffic through the API Gateway to the new services. The monolith gets smaller and smaller.

#### **Phase 3: Decommission (The Final Step)**

Eventually, all functionality will have been migrated to new microservices. The monolith will be handling zero traffic. We can then have a celebration, and finally, turn it off.

### Addressing Key Probing Areas (Modernization Context)

*   **Target Architecture & Tech Choices:** The target architecture is the same as the greenfield design: a distributed system of **.NET Core** microservices on **Kubernetes**. The key difference is the *journey* there.
*   **Cloud-Native Approach:** This is our destination. All *new* services will be built cloud-native from day one. As an interim step, we might "lift and shift" the existing monolith into a VM in the cloud to get it out of a private data center, even before we start strangling it. This can be a pragmatic first step to unify our infrastructure operations.
*   **Non-Functional Requirements:** During the migration, the biggest NFRs are **data consistency** and **zero downtime**. We'll use patterns like the **outbox pattern** to ensure reliable data sync and the API Gateway's routing capabilities to perform **canary releases** for new services, sending a small percentage of traffic first to validate stability before a full cutover.
*   **Organizational Structure:** This is critical. You can't have the "monolith team" and the "microservices team" become adversaries.
    *   I would create a small, dedicated **Modernization Platform Team** (an enabling team). Their job is to build the "paved road" for the new microservices: the CI/CD templates, the Kubernetes platform, and the initial Strangler Façade.
    *   The existing monolith feature teams would then be gradually repurposed into **Domain-Oriented Teams**. As we decide to strangle the 'Search' functionality, the engineers who know 'Search' best will form the core of the new 'Search Microservice' team, using the tools provided by the platform team. This leverages their deep domain knowledge while empowering them to build with modern technology.
