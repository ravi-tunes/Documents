# Interview Prep: Director of Software Engineering (JPMC)
## Theme: Strategy, Vision, and Execution

### Introduction: From Manager to Strategic Leader
These questions are designed to see if you can operate at a Director's altitude. The interviewer is looking for evidence that you can think beyond the current quarter, connect technology initiatives to long-term business goals, and create a clear, compelling vision that your teams and stakeholders can rally behind. A great answer here demonstrates foresight, business acumen, and the ability to translate a high-level strategy into a concrete, executable plan.

### Question 1: "If you were to get this role, what would your first 90 days look like?"

#### What's Really Being Asked (The Evaluation):
*   Do you have a structured, thoughtful approach to entering a new organization?
*   Do you understand the importance of listening and learning before acting?
*   Do you know *what* you need to learn to be effective (people, process, technology, business)?
*   Can you balance learning with the need to establish credibility and deliver early value?

#### Structuring Your Answer:
Use the classic 30-60-90 day framework. This shows you are methodical and have done this before.
1.  **First 30 Days: Learn & Listen.** The focus is on total immersion and absorption.
2.  **Next 30 Days: Synthesize & Formulate.** The focus is on connecting dots and forming hypotheses.
3.  **Final 30 Days: Plan & Align.** The focus is on socializing a plan and identifying initial actions.

#### A Good Answer (Level 1 - Competent):
"In my first 30 days, I'd meet my team and my manager to understand their priorities. In the next 30, I'd start looking at the code and the tech stack. By day 90, I would have a good idea of what we need to work on and would present my plan."

---

#### The Best Response (Level 2 - Systematic & Comprehensive):
"My approach to the first 90 days is a structured listening and learning tour, designed to build trust and a deep understanding of the landscape before making any significant changes. I break it down into three phases:

**Phase 1: First 30 Days - Learn (Absorb and Listen)**
*   **Goal:** Build relationships and understand the 'why' behind the current state.
*   **Actions:**
    *   **People:** Schedule 1:1s with every member of my direct team, my peer Directors, my key product and business stakeholders, and my boss. My primary questions are: 'What's working well?', 'What's frustrating?', and 'If you were me, what would you focus on first?'
    *   **Technology:** Conduct deep dives with the tech leads. I want to understand the system architecture, the CI/CD pipeline, the operational health (dashboards, alerts), and the biggest sources of technical debt.
    *   **Process:** Sit in on all key team rituals: stand-ups, sprint planning, retrospectives, and architecture reviews. I'm there to observe, not to judge or direct.
*   **Deliverable:** A private document of observations and open questions. No conclusions yet.

**Phase 2: Days 31-60 - Synthesize (Analyze and Formulate)**
*   **Goal:** Connect the dots between what I've heard and what I've seen, and formulate initial hypotheses.
*   **Actions:**
    *   **Identify Themes:** Synthesize my notes to identify recurring themes across people, process, and tech. (e.g., 'Release process is slow and manual,' 'Team X feels disconnected from the business mission,' 'We have a monitoring gap for Service Y').
    *   **Find a 'Quick Win':** Identify a small, highly visible, and universally agreed-upon problem I can help the team solve. This builds credibility and momentum.
    *   **Draft a 'State of the Union':** Begin drafting a document that outlines my understanding of the organization's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
*   **Deliverable:** A validated list of themes and a plan for a quick win to be executed.

**Phase 3: Days 61-90 - Plan (Align and Initiate)**
*   **Goal:** Socialize my findings and collaboratively build the initial 6-month roadmap.
*   **Actions:**
    *   **Share the 'State of the Union':** Present my documented findings to my leadership and my teams. This is a crucial step to validate my understanding and build consensus ('Does this picture resonate with your experience?').
    *   **Facilitate Roadmap Creation:** Based on the validated findings, I will facilitate planning sessions with my teams and product partners to define our key objectives and key results (OKRs) for the next two quarters.
    *   **Launch the 'Quick Win':** Ensure the quick-win project from Phase 2 is delivered successfully.
*   **Deliverable:** A collaboratively developed and broadly supported 6-month strategic roadmap with clear priorities and success metrics."

### Question 2: "Tell me about a time a major project you were leading was failing or significantly off-track. What did you do to turn it around?"

#### What's Really Being Asked (The Evaluation):
*   How do you behave under pressure? Do you panic and blame, or do you take ownership?
*   Do you have a systematic process for crisis management?
*   Can you make hard choices (e.g., cutting scope, resetting expectations)?
*   What did you learn from the failure? (This is critical).

---

#### A Good Answer (Level 1 - Competent):
"We had a project that was going to miss its deadline. I got the team together, and we identified a few features we could cut to make the date. We had to work some long hours, but we managed to deliver the core product on time."

---

#### The Best Response (Level 2 - Calm, Methodical, & Ownership-Driven):
"In my experience, projects fail slowly, then all at once. The key is to create an environment where problems are surfaced early. But when a project is already in the red, my approach is to stop, diagnose, and reset.

*   **Situation:** We were six months into a nine-month project to launch a new mobile trading application. The project was 'green' on all status reports, but my gut told me something was wrong. The engineers seemed burnt out, and demos were showing very little real progress. After a few direct conversations, the tech lead admitted they were months behind and the architecture was not scaling.
*   **Task:** My immediate task was to get an honest assessment of the situation, stop the bleeding, and present a realistic recovery plan to our stakeholders.
*   **Action:** I took a three-step approach:
    1.  **Stop and Create Safety:** I called an immediate two-day 'pencils down' stop on all new feature work. I assembled the entire team and made it clear this was a blameless diagnostic. My message was, "We are where we are. Our goal is not to assign blame, but to build a real plan to get to the finish line together." This created the psychological safety needed for people to be honest.
    2.  **Diagnose the Root Cause:** We spent those two days re-evaluating the entire project. We mapped out what was truly done, what was in progress, and what hadn't been started. We discovered the root cause wasn't the engineers' speed; it was a fundamental flaw in the initial architecture and massive, undocumented scope creep.
    3.  **Re-Plan and Communicate:** Armed with a true understanding of the work remaining, I worked with the team and Product to define a new, realistic plan. This involved a painful but necessary de-scoping of 40% of the 'nice-to-have' features for a 'Version 1.0' launch. I then took this new plan to our stakeholders. I didn't sugarcoat it. I explained *why* we were off-track (the root causes), what our new, high-confidence plan was, and what we would deliver and when.
*   **Result:** The conversation with stakeholders was tough, but they respected the honesty and the clear, data-backed plan. We hit the revised deadline for the V1.0 launch. The most important result was the cultural shift on the team. We implemented better progress tracking (e.g., regular, integrated demos) and the team felt safe to raise red flags early. The project's near-failure became a catalyst for us becoming a much healthier, higher-performing organization."

### Question 3: "How do you balance innovation and experimentation with the operational stability required in a financial institution?"

#### What's Really Being Asked (The Evaluation):
*   Do you understand the extreme importance of stability and security in a financial context?
*   Do you have a practical framework for managing risk while still making progress?
*   Can you foster a culture of innovation without encouraging recklessness?

---

#### The Best Response (Level 2 - A Portfolio Approach):
"This is the central strategic challenge in financial technology. You can't use the 'move fast and break things' model when you're managing people's money. My approach is to treat our engineering capacity like a diversified investment portfolio, balancing risk and reward across different types of work. I typically visualize it as a 70/20/10 split:

*   **70% - Core Business:** This is the majority of our effort, dedicated to delivering on the committed product roadmap and maintaining the core systems. These projects are well-understood, have clear business value, and follow our most rigorous development, security, and testing standards. This is where we maximize stability.

*   **20% - Adjacent Innovation:** This is our investment in the near-future. It includes paying down strategic technical debt, modernizing a component of our stack, or running experiments to improve an existing product. For example, we might run an A/B test on a new UI or build a proof-of-concept for a faster database technology. The risk is managedâ€”these experiments are time-boxed, have clear success metrics, and are built behind feature flags so they can be rolled back instantly without impacting the core service.

*   **10% - Transformational Bets:** This is our R&D. It's for exploring genuinely new, high-risk, high-reward ideas. This work is explicitly firewalled from our production environment. We do this through mechanisms like:
    *   **Internal Hackathons:** One or two days where teams can work on any idea they want.
    *   **Architectural Spikes:** Time-boxed research tasks to evaluate a new technology (e.g., 'Can we use a graph database for fraud detection?').
    *   **Incubation Teams:** A small, separate team might be given a quarter to build a prototype of a completely new product concept.

This portfolio approach allows us to provide a predictable, stable delivery engine for the core business while creating sanctioned, risk-managed outlets for the innovation that is essential to staying competitive."

### Question 4: "Describe a time you had to make a significant technical decision with incomplete information. What was your process and how did you justify the decision?"

#### What's Really Being Asked (The Evaluation):
*   How do you deal with ambiguity? Do you get paralyzed, or do you have a framework for moving forward?
*   How do you balance speed with the need for data?
*   Can you make a decision and commit to it, while also planning for the possibility that you might be wrong?

---

#### The Best Response (Level 2 - Framework-Driven & Risk-Aware):
"Making decisions under uncertainty is a huge part of the job. My framework is to **constrain the ambiguity, make the decision reversible if possible, and optimize for our long-term principles.**

*   **Situation:** We were building a new data ingestion service and had to choose between two competing technologies for our message queue: a well-established, familiar technology we'd used before (like RabbitMQ) and a newer, cloud-native technology that promised much higher performance but had a steeper learning curve for the team (like NATS or a similar CNCF project). We only had two weeks to make the decision to avoid delaying the project, which wasn't enough time for a full, production-grade bake-off.
*   **Task:** I needed to lead the team to a decision that was fast, defensible, and wouldn't lock us into a bad path.
*   **Action:** I used a structured, time-boxed process:
    1.  **Frame the Decision & State Principles:** I gathered the tech leads and stated our goal: "We will make a decision in one week." I also proposed the key principles we should optimize for: 1) Developer Velocity, 2) Scalability for our 3-year forecast, and 3) Long-term operational cost.
    2.  **Assign Asynchronous Research:** I assigned two senior engineers to be the 'champions' for each technology. Their job was not to win, but to build the strongest possible case for their assigned option in three days, focusing on our stated principles.
    3.  **Hold a Formal Review & Debate:** We held a one-hour meeting where each champion presented their findings. This was followed by a structured debate.
    4.  **Make a Reversible Decision:** The debate was inconclusive on performance. The cloud-native option *seemed* better, but it was an unknown. The core insight was that the message queue was an internal detail of our service. This led to our decision: "We will choose the newer, cloud-native technology because it better aligns with our long-term strategic direction. **However**, we will explicitly design our service with an abstraction layer (an adapter pattern) around the message queue client. This makes the decision reversible."
*   **Result:** We documented this choice in an Architectural Decision Record (ADR), explaining *why* we chose it and noting the risk and our mitigation strategy (the abstraction layer). The team was able to move forward with speed and confidence. Six months later, we found a limitation in the new tech, and because of the abstraction layer, we were able to swap it out for the older, more stable option in just one sprintâ€”a huge validation of the decision-making process."
